### Command Line Utility (vcmd)

A bunch of command line utilities are implemented by python3 to speed up your edit and development, named ***vcmd***.
***vcmd*** simplifies common operations in most scenarios of developing and editing, include:

* `vencode`: Encode/decode text strings.
* `vfile`: File operations such as a) delete files with a specified filetype, b) replace content in files with a specified filetype, c) list files with a specified filetype, d) detect and convert file encodings with a specified filetype.
* `vconf`: Configure `compile_commands.json` for C/C++ language server clangd, generate ssh key for host, homebrew/python-pip/ubuntu/fedora/manjaro... mirrors to speed up, etc.
* `vgit`: Git operations without the burden of time consuming remember.
* `vip`: Ip address calculations for both ipv4 and ipv6.
* `vpack`: Easier file/directory compression and extraction.
* `vag`: Fast text search wrapped the_silver_search ag.
* `vtime`: Easier time calculations.

For better understanding and use, help document is supported for all commands, contains command functionality, options and examples.
Here's an example of `vencode`:

```
$ vencode -h
usage: vencode [option] text

  Encode and decode text strings with algorithms.

option:
  -e/--encode [algorithm]       encode text with specified algorithm
  -d/--decode [algorithm]       decode text with specified algorithm

  -h/--help                     show help message

algorithm:
  base64                        base64 algorithm
  url                           url algorithm

example:
  $ vencode -ebase64 'Hello World'
  Hello World => SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=
```

Please try these commands with `-h` option for more details.
